# Hand Tracking with OpenCV & MediaPipe  

This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks in real time using a webcam. Each landmark is displayed with different colors, and hand connections are drawn with distinct visual styling.  

## Features  

- Real-time hand tracking using a webcam  
- Landmark detection with color-coded points  
- Custom drawing styles for hand connections  
- Press **'q'** to exit the application  

## Prerequisites  

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3 recommended). Then, install the required dependencies:  

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

##How to Run
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand_landmark_detection.git
cd hand_landmark_detection
```

Run the script:
```bash
python app.py
```
The webcam will open, and hand tracking will begin.
